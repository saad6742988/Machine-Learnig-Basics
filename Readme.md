# Machine Learning
Computers can perform some tasks a way better than humans, like huge calculations and searching in huge data.

While, humans can perform some tasks in a better way, like driving and recognizing objects.

So, **Machine Learning** is a technique that makes computer capable of performing those tasks that a human can do more effeciently.

Machine learning is a vast feild that encapsulates Deep learning through data/inputs using mathematical/statistical models.

Different ML Algorithms and their implementation:
