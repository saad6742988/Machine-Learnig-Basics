# Simple Linear Regreesion
Simple Linear Regreesion is a type of **Linear Regression** with a single explanatory variable.
In other word, it describes the relationship between **one dependant** and **one independant** varible using a straight line.
You can also say it aims to find a Linear Relationship to describe the correlation between independant and posibly dependat varible.

In our case, **Area** will be independant and **Price** will be dependant on area.

| Area  | Price |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 2600      | 550000    |
| 3000      | 565000    |
| 3200      | 610000    |
| 3600      | 80000     |
| 4000      | 25000     |
# Behind the  Model
In Algebra, you have learned about **Linear Equation** some where. That is

`y = mx + b`

This equation uses the slope that is 'm' and interception point that is 'b'. You can see detailed view in image below:
