# Save and Load Models
In Machine Learning, saving models is essential because training is often time-consuming and resource-intensive. By saving a trained model, you can reuse it consistently without retraining, which is crucial for deployment, real-time applications, and maintaining reproducibility across different environments.

Two mostly used ways to save models:
### Using Pickle
**To save model,**
```
with open ("Model_pickle",'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(MyModel,file)
```
'wb' means that we are writing model in binary format. there can be some other formats too.

**To load model,**
```
with open ("Model_pickle",'rb') as file:
    load_pickle_model = pickle.load(file)
```
'rb' means that we are reading model from binary format.
### Using Joblib
**To save model,**
```
joblib.dump(MyModel,"Model_joblib")
```

**To load model,**
```
load_joblib_model = joblib.load("Model_joblib")
```

**Ofcourse, you have to import `pickle` and `joblib` first.**

## Difference between Pickle & Joblib
**Pickle** is commonly used when the focus is on simplicity and compatibility within Python environments. It is suitable for small to medium-sized models and datasets.

**Joblib** is ideal for saving and loading machine learning models that involve large numerical arrays,
such as those generated by `NumPy` or `scikit-learn`.
It is more efficient and faster than pickle and also supports parallel processing.
